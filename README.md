This pandemic has made online classes a necessity. But having students devote their attention to the screen is not a piece of cake. We at Hocus-Focus have came up with an exciting and innovative solution to keep them engaged. Every few minutes, the student will be prompted with a question and exciting part is that these questions have nothing to do with the tutor and is auto-generated by the system. The scores they obtain decide their attendance.
